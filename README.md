# Predicting_brent_oil_prices

## data visualization
> a line chart showing brent oil prices for the last 20 year(1999 - 2019) was plottes in order to give an idea of how the prices have been changing

## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
+ The data given only has one column which is the brent oil prices. Two additional columns were created which are the 3-day and 9-day moving averages. 
+ Rows with Nan values were dropped 

## predicting brent prices
The long short-term memory(LSTM) and linear regressionn were used for the prediction
> the accuracy measures used are 
+ mean squared error
+ root mean squared error
+ mean absolute error


The project aim to predict oil prices with brent oil as the case study using linear regression and machine learning and then investigate which one is better
